New instances are obtained throughrandomly setting a point in a two dimensional space, such that these dimensionscorresponds to f1and f2. This two dimensional space is split into four blocks,each of which corresponds to one of four diﬀerent functions. In each block a pointbelongs to class 1 if f1+f2≤θand to class 0 otherwise.
