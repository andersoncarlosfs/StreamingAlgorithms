# Project summary

### Evaluation

- Compare with regular Hoeffding tree (evaluateprequential matplotlib) : if both classifiers are very similar, there is probably something wrong ... Look at the Test part  at the end of the notebook.

### Tests on datasets
You can find datatsets at :
- sklearn.datasets
- https://github.com/scikit-multiflow/scikit-multiflow/tree/master/skmultiflow/datasets

We should compare about 2 or 3 datasets to properly illustrate the reuslts of our implementation of ARF.
